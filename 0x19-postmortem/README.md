                        <p>Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error&hellip; Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won&rsquo;t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.</p>
                        <p>A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To provide the rest of the company&rsquo;s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.</li>
                            <li>And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)</p>
                            <p>Requirements:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Issue Summary (that is often what executives will read) must contain:<ul>
                                        <li>duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone)</li>
                                        <li>what was the impact (what service was down/slow? What were user experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?)</li>
                                        <li>what was the root cause</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Timeline (format bullet point, format:&nbsp;<code>time</code> -&nbsp;<code>keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences</code>) must contain:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>when was the issue detected</li>
                                        <li>how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained&hellip;)</li>
                                        <li>actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)</li>
                                        <li>misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken</li>
                                        <li>which team/individuals was the incident escalated to</li>
                                        <li>how the incident was resolved</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <ul>

                                <li>
                                    <p>Corrective and preventative measures must contain:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>what are the things that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)</li>
                                        <li>a list of tasks to address the issue (be very specific, like a TODO, example: patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory&hellip;)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Be brief and straight to the point, between 400 to 600 words</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>While postmortem format can vary, stick to this one so that you can get properly reviewed by your peers.</p>
